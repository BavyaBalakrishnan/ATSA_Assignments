Optimize the log-periodic power law (LPPL) parameters Differential Evolution (DE) for predicting stock price crisis.
Dataset used : Daily data collected from National Stock exchange India from 2019-08-01 to 2020-05-14. Close price of N50 is used for evaluation.
Python programing language is used to Optimize the log-periodic power law (LPPL) parameters using Differential Evolution optimizer for Predicting the stock price crisis. Libraries used: scipyâ€™s
optimize library,numpy,pandas,matplotlib Differential Evolution is a stochastic, population-based optimization algorithm for solving nonlinear optimization problems. This algorithm was introduced by Storn and Price in 1996. Differential
evolution try to optimize a problem by keeping a population of candidate solutions and according to its simple formulae, constructing new solutions by combining existing candidate solutions. Then
keeping whichever candidate solution has the best score or fitness on the optimization problem at hand.
