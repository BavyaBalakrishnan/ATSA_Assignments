Stock market. Since India emerged as an important part in Oil market by replacing Japan to become the third largest Oil Importer, understanding the correlation in the context of India gained
importance more than ever before. The price of oil has sunk to levels not seen since 2002 as demand for crude collapses amid the coronavirus pandemic. Energy stocks constituted around 12.5
